            <h2> About Us</h2>
            <p>I.B. (PG) College is a premier co-educational Govt. Aided institution in Haryana. It was founded in 1956 in the memory of the well wisher of Leiah Biradari Late Sh. Inder Bhan Dhingra. Keeping in view the requirement of education for women, Late Seth Brij Lal Dhingra with the help of his energetic friends Late Sh. Shanu Lal Narang & Late Sh. Sukh Dayal Sachdeva, founded this college for women only. In 1966, the college started working as a co-educational institute. The college progressed by leaps and bounds under the leadership of Late Dr. Somnath Dhingra and Late Sh. Ram Kishan Gandhir who worked in the capacity of erstwhile President & Vice President respectively.

            The college has steadily built up over the past six decades, maintaining high traditions of scholastic excellence along with the culture of discipline and social service. The overall goal is to prepare the students to play roles in the society with responsibility and commitment.</p>
